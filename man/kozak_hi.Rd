\title{Estimate the height at which a given diameter occurs in a tree, based on a fitted Kozak (2004) taper equation.}
\usage{
kozak_hi(dbh, h, di, coef, p)
}
\arguments{
\item{dbh}{tree diameter at breast height, in centimeters.}

\item{h}{total tree height, in meters.}

\item{di}{diameter whose height of occurrence will be estimated, in centimeters.}

\item{coef}{numerical vector containing nine coefficients of the Kozak taper equation}

\item{p}{numerical value representing the first inflection point calculated in the segmented model of Max and Burkhart (1976).}
}
\value{
as numeric value indicating the height at which the given diameter occurs.
}
\description{
Estimates the height at which a given diameter occurs in a tree, from the diameter at breast height, total height and coefficients of the Kozak (2004) taper function.
}
\details{
the Kozak (2004) variable-form taper function is represented mathematically by the following expression

di ~b0*(dbh^b1)\emph{(h^b2)}((1-(hi/h)^(1/4))/(1-(p^(1/3))))^(b3*(hi/h)^4+b4*(1/exp(dbh/h))+b5*((1-(hi/h)^(1/4))/(1-(p^(1/3))))^0.1+b6*(1/dbh)+b7*(h^(1-(hi/h)^(1/3)))+b8*((1-(hi/h)^(1/4))/(1-(p^(1/3)))))
