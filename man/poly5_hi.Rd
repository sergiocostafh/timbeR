\arguments{
\item{dbh}{tree diameter at breast height, in centimeters.}

\item{h}{total tree height, in meters.}

\item{di}{diameter whose height of occurrence will be estimated, in centimeters.}

\item{coef}{numerical vector containing six coefficients of the 5th degree polynomial function that describes the tree's taper.}
}
\value{
as numeric value indicating the height at which the given diameter occurs.
}
\description{
Estimates the height at which a given diameter occurs in a tree, from the diameter at breast height, total height and coefficients of the 5th degree polynomial function that describes the tree's taper.
